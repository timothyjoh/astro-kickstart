## Resources

### Fonts

All fonts are installed via NPM from Fontsource. https://fontsource.org/

1. Import fonts at the top of your Astro Layout file eg: `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
2. Add CSS classes to your Astro global css file eg: `src/styles/global.css`

### Components

This project intentionally is setup to use ARIA-tested components as a base from https://ariakit.org/

Secondarily, components from DaisyUI https://daisyui.com/ should be used where pure-tailwind components are sufficient. DaisyUI also allows a mechanism for themeability that we use to create custom themes for our clients and users.

In the case other components are needed, feel free to use Radix and ShadCn components, ensuring that your implementation of them fits with the accessibility standards of the project, and the general look-and-feel and themeable nature that DaisyUI allows.
