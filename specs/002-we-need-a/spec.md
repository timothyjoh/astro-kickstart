# Feature Specification: Site-wide DaisyUI Theme Picker

**Feature Branch**: `002-we-need-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We need a site-wide theme picker that supports all DaisyUI themes. Place a dropdown control in the upper-right corner of the main layout. Populate the dropdown dynamically from DaisyUI's theme list so every available theme shows up. The default selection should be the \"light\" theme. When a user picks a theme, apply it across the entire site by updating the root html element's data-theme attribute so DaisyUI styles switch immediately. Persist the user's selection (for example in local storage) so the preference sticks between visits. No additional accessibility or responsive requirements beyond standard keyboard and screen reader support."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a site visitor, I want to choose any DaisyUI theme from a convenient control so the entire site reflects my preferred look and feel immediately.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor is on any page with the default "light" theme active, **When** they open the theme dropdown in the upper-right corner and select another DaisyUI theme, **Then** the page restyles instantly across the full layout to match the chosen theme and the dropdown shows the new selection (Verification: `npm run astro check`, `npm run preview`).
2. **Given** a visitor previously selected a DaisyUI theme and later reloads or returns to the site, **When** the page finishes loading, **Then** the previously chosen theme is automatically applied site-wide and the dropdown indicates that choice.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a DaisyUI theme becomes unavailable or is removed from the library? → The dropdown must omit unavailable entries and gracefully retain the default theme.
- How does system handle situations where browser storage is blocked or cleared? → The site should revert to the default "light" theme without errors while keeping the picker functional.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST present a theme selection dropdown in the upper-right area of the global layout on every page.
- **FR-002**: System MUST populate the dropdown with the full set of DaisyUI themes available at runtime without manual curation.
- **FR-003**: System MUST display "light" as the default theme for first-time or reset visitors.
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply the selected theme across the entire site immediately after selection without requiring a page reload.
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist the visitor's most recent theme selection across sessions using browser-based storage so it re-applies automatically.
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure the dropdown supports standard keyboard navigation and exposes an accessible label for screen readers.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Theme Option**: Represents a single DaisyUI theme name that can be presented in the dropdown.
- **Theme Preference**: Represents the visitor's persisted theme choice, including the DaisyUI theme identifier and the timestamp of last update (for auditing or debugging).
