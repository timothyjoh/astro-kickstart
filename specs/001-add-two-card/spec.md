# Feature Specification: Homepage Demo Cards

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-two-card`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add two card-style links under the homepage hero section that navigate to existing demo pages. Include a card for the Blog located at src/pages/blog that links to /blog and a card for the Todo app located at src/pages/todo.astro that links to /todo. Each card should stay in the same tab when clicked, use the site’s card style, include a concise description, and incorporate an appropriate icon for the content."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor landing on the homepage hero, I want to immediately see visual cards that guide me to the Blog and Todo demos so I can explore the examples that interest me next.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor views the homepage, **When** they scroll just below the hero, **Then** they see two cards styled consistently with existing card patterns, labelled for the Blog and Todo demos with titles, descriptions, and contextual icons.
2. **Given** a visitor clicks either the Blog or Todo card, **When** the interaction is triggered, **Then** the site navigates in the same tab to `/blog` or `/todo` respectively and the card’s descriptive text remains accessible to assistive tech.
3. **Given** the feature is implemented, **When** the team runs `npm run astro check` and manually previews the homepage, **Then** the commands complete without errors and the cards appear as described across desktop and mobile viewports.

### Edge Cases
- If an icon asset cannot load, the card still presents the title and description clearly so the destination remains understandable.
- On small screens, the cards stack vertically with adequate spacing and touch-friendly targets so both links remain usable.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The homepage MUST render exactly two demo cards directly beneath the hero section, using the established site card style for visual consistency.
- **FR-002**: The Blog demo card MUST include a clear title referencing the blog, a short description explaining the content, an icon that conveys reading or articles, and it MUST link to `/blog`.
- **FR-003**: The Todo demo card MUST include a clear title referencing the todo app, a short description explaining its purpose, an icon that conveys tasks or checklists, and it MUST link to `/todo`.
- **FR-004**: Clicking either card MUST navigate within the same browser tab without opening a new window or disrupting the page structure.
- **FR-005**: Both cards MUST remain accessible, providing meaningful text alternatives for icons and ensuring the entire card has an accessible name for screen readers.

## Assumptions & Dependencies
- Existing hero content remains unchanged; the new cards are inserted immediately beneath it.
- The project’s current icon system provides suitable blog and task icons; if not, a visually consistent alternative from an approved source is selected.
- The Blog (`/blog`) and Todo (`/todo`) routes already exist and remain the navigation targets.
- No content collection or schema updates are required; the cards rely on static copy defined within the homepage layout.
